# Product Context: Headless

## Problem Statement
Rails developers want to use HeadlessUI's powerful, accessible components but need a Rails-native solution that integrates well with ViewComponent and Stimulus.js. The current HeadlessUI implementation is primarily for React, making it difficult to use in Rails applications while maintaining the same level of accessibility and flexibility.

## Solution
Headless provides a Rails-native implementation of HeadlessUI components by:
- Converting HeadlessUI components to use Stimulus.js for behavior
- Implementing components using Rails ViewComponent
- Maintaining the same accessibility features
- Keeping components unstyled and customizable
- Providing a familiar API for Rails developers

## User Experience Goals
1. **Familiarity**: Rails developers should feel at home with the API
2. **Accessibility**: Maintain HeadlessUI's accessibility standards
3. **Flexibility**: Keep components unstyled and customizable
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Rails and Stimulus.js
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and examples

## Target Users
- Rails developers using HeadlessUI in React
- Teams wanting accessible components in Rails
- Developers valuing unstyled, customizable components
- Projects requiring Rails-native UI components
